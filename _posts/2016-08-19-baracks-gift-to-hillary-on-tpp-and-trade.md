# Barack's gift to Hillary on TPP and Trade

President Obama stated recently that he would make the case for why the US should ratify the TPP, an international agreement that sets its ambitions beyond traditional trade agreements. When Obama makes the case, he needs to do more than just explain the virtues of the TPP: he needs to help the next president reset the US agenda on trade. That case is all about America's ability to trade, adapt and better divide the pie and share the pain.

Making the case for TPP is an uphill battle. Despite some shortcomings, the TPP needs to be passed, not only for the US strategic interest, but also because US leadership in this area can help to define important principles and precedents for the next generation of global economic relationships.

More than just the benefits, the case for TPP must deliver a vision for a future that puts it in the transformational context that Hillary Clinton faces as she seeks to reconcile demands from both parties for a more dynamic and fair economy. This vision, rather than being anti-internationalist needs to call Americans to take a path toward greater participation at home and abroad toward more openness, innovation, and competitiveness. Domestically it is a matter of building mechanisms that extend training, and supportive regulatory frameworks that enable Americans to better innovate and compete, providing on-ramps into international commerce. For those that are displaced---and this will be an increasing proportion of the economy even without trade---new shock absorbers must be available that help people adapt, transition, and retool.

The TPP deal is a good one, with many great economists and pundits focusing on the incremental economic impacts versus the game-changing set of new rules that will be needed for the new economy. Among these are new rules on and data flows---which undergird virtually every business, domestically and internationally---that will ensure that this currency of business and democracies will remain open. Provisions on encryption and source codes ensure that countries agree that breaking and stealing them will be against the law and protected through each member's legal system. It also includes new labour and environmental provisions that reflect the increasing importance of managing international commercial relationships in their full context and it extends the coordination to a number of mechanisms from standard setting to support for small and medium enterprises.

But you would have to be in a time warp to not realise that as the plate is being delivered to the table, the taste for globalisation has been rapidly souring. Guilty as charged: the new economy has failed to deliver on growth; has led to rising inequality; and has advanced the interests of the elites over the other 99%.

But the problem with this new economy is not in international agreements: it is at home. Domestic competitiveness strategies for all countries have been shaped by centuries of mercantile logic and corporate favouritism and these policies have been embedded in national and international systems that reflect an "export is winning" and "import is losing" mentality. But the new benchmarks are all about added value that can be gained through harnessing value chains, investment strategies, and the vitality and adaptability of markets to produce whatever, whenever given a set of evolving resources and business and consumer demands. It is fast and fluid and our institutions are on the one hand behind in adapting to it and on the other constrained by the most powerful actors who thrive in such systems.

Ironically this new economy offers extraordinary potential to include huge swathes of our populations---from the North America to Africa---directly in international trade, innovating and mixing outsourced and specialised goods and services that give small businesses a big reach. [Ebay's data][0] on those who use its platform to trade internationally are compelling: they show more profitable and resilient businesses than their offline counterparts. The developing world is experiencing dramatic changes with new technologies transforming, old businesses such as farming; and with remote producers immediately connected to consumers through virtual market places. BPO services are flourishing across Africa and Asia among others, providing skilled work through international trade. The right framework of international rules can help to further unleash these trends.

The US economy is vital and dynamic, but it could be so much more and the US has an opportunity to walk the talk in reshaping international trade. Americans say our economy is the most open in the world, and by and large the trade rules confirm this. But this statement belies myriad inflexibilities and a lack of "trade readiness". American's find that an increasingly competitive global economy is an opportunity for some, but not necessarily one for those that are displaced. Finding new work in this economy is made more difficult through inadequate support for the basis of innovation and adaptation, including vocational and higher education. Instead people are actively discouraged from these avenues as they become saddled with unbearable debt. The economy is also riddled with senseless barriers that make it difficult to move. Try working as a teacher or doctor in one state and moving to another state: it can take years to qualify. Forget it if you are a professional abroad.

Bamboozled by years of highly ideological debate, Americans remain convinced that they have too much government. But they suffer from too much of the wrong kind of governance and too little of the kind that makes our economies adaptive, innovative, and provides a framework for doing so systemically---and not just for trade.

America's faith in the market working it out is a sop to those who have lost their jobs to trade agreements. It is too little, too late. The new economy demands policies that provide broad labour market support for training and transitioning. Burdening employers with the costs made sense in the old economy, but it does not make sense in the new one, where morphing business models and mobility are the rule. Supporting such policies is the role of the central government---and horrors---it may mean larger government---the sign of a marked politician for many years. But it is the right direction for the time.

This new economy does not mean the Uberisation of everything with a consequent abandonment of labour and consumer protections. Again, government must redefine its role to support the growth of such businesses, but also to ensure that workers access to job markets, training and retirement benefits. Increasingly as our economy transforms toward greater use of robots, artificial intelligence and other hugely productive technologies we need to ensure that the welfare of our population is also cultivated. We need to find again what Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps refers to as a sense of individual agency and the conditions to innovate effectively which have been lost in the shadows and slogans of the old economy.

We're not talking about more of the same old story. With freedom to trade and economies that are "trade ready" such participation has the potential to radically change who participates in our economies and the political constituencies that support extending international commercial relationships.

So, President Obama, when you take the stage to defend the TPP, please do what you have been doing so well for the past eight years: tee up the discussion and vision for the future that Hillary Clinton can grab and run with. It may not save the TPP in the short run, but America's and the world's livelihoods depend on it.
